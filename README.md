# Experimentation

This branch is dedicated to the pure experimentation of solutions based on our research problem, through the analysis and comparison of low-level visual features in Impressionist artworks. We will implement and evaluate similarity algorithms and visual comparison metrics.

## Features
- **Artistic Comparison**: Compare paintings based on visual similarity.
- **Transformations**: Apply transformations to highlight relevant features and refine comparison results.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore outcomes through dynamic visualizations.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques to extract feature representations.
- **Image-Based Testing**: Conduct rigorous testing using diverse sets of transformed and original images to validate visual similarity metrics.
